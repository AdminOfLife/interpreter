# some variables to use in expressions.

a = 5 ;
b = 10 ;
c = 15 ;
d = 20 ;

# * and / have higher precedence than + or -
print a + b * 2 - c / 5 ;
print "\n";

# But, parentheses can still change things.
print ( a + b ) * ( 2 - c ) / 5 ;
print "\n";

print ( ( ( a + b ) * 2 ) - c ) / 5 ;
print "\n";
